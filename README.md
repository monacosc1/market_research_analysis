* Driving these numbers are the almost 8.8 million adults in the U.S. in early January said they couldn’t work
because they were sick with or taking care of someone sick with Covid-19, according to a Census Bureau
survey.

### Job Openings
* The U.S. as a whole lost more than 22 million jobs from the pandemic and at the end of 2021 still had
3.6 million fewer positions than in February 2020.
* The number of job openings has declined in recent months. Demand for workers is cooling across the economy

### Nonfarm Payrolls & Average Hourly Wage Change
* Several additional factors continue to impact the health of small businesses in the U.S. The unemployment
rate dropped again last month, helping to bid up wages at a faster pace than before the pandemic, particularly
in labor-intensive, in-person industries like leisure and hospitality

## Consumer Credit Summary
### Total Debt & Composition
* Even as the pandemic shuttered businesses and ruined personal finances, for many, the opposite happened.
Shutdowns and unemployment reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression were met with trillions of
dollars in government stimulus and the economy’s swift recovery.

### New Mortgage Originations
* Across several industries, the average daily balance of business bank accounts have grown since the start
of the pandemic, as businesses and consumers alike saved and built up cash buffers to deal with further
unexpected events. As a result, the borrower profile has shifted dramatically for those looking to take on
new credit.
